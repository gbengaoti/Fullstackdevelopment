Summary - constructor functions
JavaScript's class system is built directly on using functions and objects. Calling (i.e., invoking) a constructor function with the new operator instantiates a new object. The same constructor function can be used to create different objects.

We've discussed functions, objects, and this throughout this course. As it turns out, all three are very much interconnected with one another! We'll examine their relationship in the next section as we take an in-depth look at the this keyword.
